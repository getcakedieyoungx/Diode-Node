### ðŸ”¹ 1. Let's update the general system
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Check if Snap Package Manager is Installed
(Usually pre-installed in Ubuntu, but let's make sure)
```
sudo apt install snapd -y
```


### ðŸ”¹ 3. Diode Node Paketini Kur
```
sudo snap install diode-node
```
After installation, diode-node starts running in the background.


### ðŸ”¹ 4. Install Diode Node Package
```
diode-node.info
```
This command shows information about your node such as its identity, connected network, and operational status.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Example Web Broadcast with Diode Client (Optional)
If you want to broadcast a directory over the Diode Network:
```
mkdir mysite
echo "Hello Diode" > mysite/index.html
diode publish mysite
```
After this process, you'll get a unique .diode.link URL. You can visit this address in your web browser to view the content.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. (Optional) Monitor Logs to Keep Node Running Continuously
```
journalctl -u snap.diode-node.daemon -f
```
With this command, you can monitor the background node logs.

### ðŸ”¹ 13. Register your running node like the example below. The part labeled NODEID can be found from the diode-node.info command output. Iâ€™ve added an example below. You can name NODEALIAS however you like. You can register as many nodes as you wantâ€”there are no limits.
```
register node NODEID NODENAME
```
